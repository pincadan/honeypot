# Here is a simple Python Honeypot that logs attempted logins to a file. 
#This is for educational purposes only and should not be used in a production environment without proper security measures.
#This Honeypot listens for incoming connections on port 22 (SSH).
#When a connection is made, it receives the data, logs the attempt to a file called honeypot.log, and then closes the connection.
#To run this code, you need to have Python installed. 
#Save it to a file, for example honeypot.py, and run it with python honeypot.py.
#Please note that this is a very basic Honeypot and does not attempt to mimic a real SSH server. 
#It simply logs the attempted logins and closes the connection. 
#For a more sophisticated Honeypot, you would need to implement the SSH protocol and respond to specific commands.
#Also, this code is for educational purposes and should only be run in a controlled environment with appropriate security measures in place. 
#Do not use this code in a production environment without proper authorization and testing !!!
